Example - 1
 On the first example the memorization or callback works because useEffect dependency
 and the created instance is considered the same since its memorized! 
 so useMemo and useCallback actually did something.

Example - 2
 On the second example useCallback did nothing because like we all know about 
 react. When the parent component rerenders every child rerenders doesn't matter
 if we use useCallback or useMemo it would just end up being the anti pattern!

 And that's when React.memo come in handy because it memorizes the component 
 itself. If this component is wrapped in React.memo, then and only then will React stop and check its
 props.

 If none of the props change, then the component will not be re-
 rendered.
