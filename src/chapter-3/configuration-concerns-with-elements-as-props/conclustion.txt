so what the author is implying is , 
we instead of making the perfect reusable component that is complicated 
with so many optional props and conditions in the Button component 
we can just make the Button component more flexible to implement easier 
minor changes logic such as Color or Icon changes.

of cause it doesn't apply for every reusable component or if your designer
have strict button styling for each buttons.

I think this still will helps me.
